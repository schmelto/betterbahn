# BetterBahn

BetterBahn is a web app for finding the best train journeys in Germany. While split ticketing is supported to help save money, it is rather the exception. The app will be extended with many more features in the future.

## Technology

This project uses the [db-vendo-client](https://github.com/public-transport/db-vendo-client) for accessing Deutsche Bahn ticketing data, which is licensed under the ISC License.

## How it works

BetterBahn searches for train journeys and can use split ticketing to help you find cheaper options—though this is usually the exception, not the rule. For a detailed explanation and demonstration, check out the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxKtI8f5QTU).
